# whisperX Subs

This repository provides a utility for processing audio files using the `whisperx` tool, with an added functionality to format subtitles based on a user-specified maximum size.

## Using the Notebook

To easily run and interact with the code, you can access the provided Jupyter notebook via Google Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lrubiorod/whisperX_subs/blob/main/whisperx_subs.ipynb)

By launching the notebook, you'll have a hands-on environment to run, modify, and experiment with the code in real-time.

## About the Tool

This utility builds upon the [whisperx repository](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) to process audio files and generate transcriptions. The added functionality in this repository allows for conditioning the generated subtitles so that they adhere to a maximum length, as specified by the user. This is particularly useful for ensuring that subtitles are easily readable and well-paced for viewers.
